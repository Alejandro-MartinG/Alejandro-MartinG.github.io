Now days I am doing my university dissertation research about web development with Ruby on Rails.
This work is doing at the Escuela Superior de Informática [(ESI)](http://webpub.esi.uclm.es/) from Ciudad Real awarded with the [EURO-INF](http://www.aneca.es/Programas-de-evaluacion/ACREDITA-PLUS/ACREDITA-PLUS-en-el-ambito-de-la-Informatica-sello-EURO-INF/Listado-titulos-acreditados-con-el-sello-EURO-INF)
seal awarded by the [European Quality Assurance Network for Informatics Education](http://www.eqanie.eu).

Actually, I am interesting in work or learning more about Big Data, Web development, Web Scraping and 
Information Systems Security.
