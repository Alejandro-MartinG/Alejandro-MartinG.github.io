## About

Panos often refers to himself in third person, but he doesn't enjoy playing this game while communicating in a <strike>written</strike> typed way.

First, thanks for dropping by. I hope that it will not waste your time, but in case it does, at least I tried. Originally from Athens, Greece, I started my adventures in Computer Science and Technology from University of Athens where I received my Bachelor in Computer Science and Master in Software Engineering. Between those, I spent a creative year in Geneva, Switzerland where I worked at CERN as a Computer Security researcher. During my Master studies I worked as a Machine Learning researcher for the <a href="http://kddlab.di.uoa.gr/" target="_blank">KDD</a> lab, supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PHJokEQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank">Dimitrios Gunopulos</a>. Finally, during the summer of my Master studies, I spent my summer in Oslo, Norway, working for Microsoft Development Center Norway, which won me and became my first working place in my post-academic life.

But, appart from being a <strike>cool guy</strike> geek, I enjoy playing and composing music, messing with hardware, playing <a href="http://deck.tk/43TX9icn" target="_blank">card games</a> and collecting comic books or vinyls. In general, my mind can zone out during any form of creative act.
